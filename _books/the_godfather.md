Embedded Autonomy: States and Industrial Transformation, by Peter B. Evans (1995), argues that successful state-led industrial development requires a balance between autonomy (insulation from interest groups) and embeddedness (strong connections to society). The book uses case studies of the computer industries in Brazil, India, and Korea to show how states can foster economic growth by building strong, selective ties with entrepreneurs and local capital, avoiding both predatory extraction and capture by special interests. It's a key text in development studies, challenging simplistic views of state intervention and highlighting the importance of state capacity and organization.
