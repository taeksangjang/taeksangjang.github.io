Welcome! I am a PhD student in International Business and Strategy at Gies College of Business, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

My research interests include global strategy, global innovation, and political strategy, with a particular emphasis on how multinational corporations (MNCs) create, transfer, and protect innovation across borders. Methodologically, I enjoy leveraging quasi-experimental empirical designs, such as difference-in-differences (DiD), to study how MNCs respond to home- and host-country institutional and policy changes.

I earned my B.A. in Management Information Systems from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS) in South Korea, and my M.Sc. in International Business & Strategy in Korea University in South Korea.

I play pretty much any sport with a ball, and I swim casually too.

I was born and raised in Busan, South Korea.
